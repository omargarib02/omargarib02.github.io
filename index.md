**I’m an MS student in Computational Science & Engineering at Georgia Tech** (Aerospace Systems Design Lab, ASDL).

I build **multimodal, human‑in‑the‑loop intelligent systems** for safety‑critical autonomy, combining **speech**, **vision**, and **3D spatial reasoning**, and I also develop **automated document/knowledge‑extraction pipelines**.

My research interests include **human–robot teaming** and **social/assistive robotics** (robots that collaborate with people, including support for individuals with disabilities).

### Highlights
- **AIRHILT** — open simulation testbed for **pilot/****air traffic control**‑in‑the‑loop evaluations (automatic speech recognition / vision / decision / text‑to‑speech).
- **SimuGAN‑Whisper‑ATC** — learned very‑high‑frequency radio noise + ASR fine‑tuning; **large word‑error‑rate reduction** on real **air traffic control**.
- **LLM/RAG document extraction** — multimodal mining of engineering PDFs for **metadata & discovery**.

### News
- **September 2025** — Began research effort on designing an effective, personalized AI companion for the elderly.
- **September 2025** — Submitted **AIRHILT** to ICRA.
- **August 2025** — Two **AIAA SciTech** abstracts accepted.
- **May 2025** — Began research collaboration with **NASA Langley** (Digital Transformation).
