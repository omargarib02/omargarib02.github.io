- **MBPO dynamic rollout (Deep RL)** — adaptive schedulers; ~25% return gain vs fixed on Hopper-v5.  
- **PSPNet segmentation (CV)** — CamVid model adapted to KITTI road segmentation (~0.86 mIoU).  
- **Visual geometry & stitching (CV)** — homography estimation + manual blending.  
- **LoRA-tuned LLM for dialog (NLP)** — 4-bit PEFT/LoRA; top-p & beam decoding.
