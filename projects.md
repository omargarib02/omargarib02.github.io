- **Dynamic rollout for MBPO (Deep RL).** Adaptive schedulers (uncertainty‑aware truncation, error/stability gating, gradient‑based horizons) → **~25% higher return** vs. fixed on Hopper‑v5 while avoiding long‑horizon collapse.

- **PSPNet semantic segmentation (CV).** Trained on CamVid and **adapted** to KITTI road segmentation (binary), achieving **~0.86 mIoU** on validation.

- **Visual geometry & panorama stitching (CV).** Estimated projection/fundamental matrices; RANSAC; custom DLT/SVD homography + manual warping/blending.

- **Parameter‑efficient LLM for dialog (NLP).** **4‑bit** OPT‑1.3B with PEFT/**LoRA**; implemented top‑p and beam search.
